**Power Transformer Electrical Tests Simulation**
**Overview:**
This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating power transformer electrical tests. The simulation exercise focuses on modeling various scenarios, including normal operation and internal faults, using the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP).

**Key Features:**
Transformer Model: A detailed MATLAB model of a power transformer, including parameters such as resistance, inductance, mutual inductance, capacitance, and specifications like nominal voltage, power, and frequency.
**Simulation Scenarios:** Three specific scenarios simulated:
	Scenario 1: No Faults (Normal Operation)

	Scenario 2: Winding Fault in Primary Winding

	Scenario 3: Core Fault
**Simulation Results:** The repository includes MATLAB code for executing simulations and generating figures for each scenario. Results are presented and analyzed, showcasing the impact of internal faults on transformer behavior.
